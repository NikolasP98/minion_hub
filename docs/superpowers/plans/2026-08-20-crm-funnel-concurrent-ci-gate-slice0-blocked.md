# Slice 0 recon result: BLOCKED (stop-ship) — CRM funnel concurrency CI gate

**Spec:** `2026-08-20-handoff-minion-hub-3530856808-spec` — "Wire
`crm-funnel.concurrent.integration.test.ts` into a real CI gate".
**Stage:** dev, Slice 0 (recon) — run `0eb02565`, 2026-08-20.
**Outcome:** Slice 0 could not be closed. Slice 1 (the CI-only schema fixture) and Slice 2
(the CI job + `TODO(handoff)` marker removal) are **not** implemented, deliberately.

## Why this file exists instead of a fixture

The spec's Slice 0 is an explicit stop-ship gate (spec §3 Slice 0, §5 A1): the real RLS policy
text and column shape for `crm_contacts` / `crm_activities` must be read from the provisioned
Supabase project (or a verified schema clone) **before** the fixture is written, and

> If neither is available when this spec reaches dev, **stop and do not guess** — a hand-authored
> RLS policy that merely follows the `_org_guc` naming convention without independent confirmation
> would silently reintroduce exactly the failure class this proposal exists to close.

A fixture reconstructed from checked-in sibling migrations was committed earlier in this run
(`e809223`, `a2a790d`) and reverted here. Reconstruction is not equivalence: if prod's real
policies, policy roles, grants, or `organizations.id` definition differ from the reconstruction,
the new CI job would go green while proving a security contract production does not have — a
milder instance of the very bug ("a test that is green because it never proved what it claims")
this spec was written to close.

## Recon performed (2026-08-20, dev sandbox, branch base `origin/master` = `678ad05`)

The spec's own Slice 0 command list was run. `origin/master` has advanced from the spec's
`5e77bbe7a` to `678ad05`, but `git diff --name-only 5e77bbe7a origin/master --
src/server/services/crm-funnel.concurrent.integration.test.ts .github/workflows/ci.yml
src/server/db/pg-crm-schema.ts` is empty — every AS-IS fact the spec asserts about those three
files still holds at `678ad05`.

This independently reproduces the AS-IS finding in spec §2 and the operator-memory finding
`hub-supabase-schema-not-reproducible`: for `organizations` and the CRM contact tables there is
**no authoritative production migration or schema snapshot** checked into the monorepo, and no
checked-in production policy/grant definition (RLS policies, grants) for them.

To be precise about what _does_ exist — the `supabase/migrations/` row above is scoped to that
directory, not to the whole repository. `create table crm_contacts` / `crm_activities` statements
are present elsewhere, but only inside self-seeding tests that build their own throwaway schemas:
`crm-contacts.sql.integration.test.ts:76`, `crm-funnel-parity.sql.integration.test.ts:122`,
`crm-contacts.service.test.ts:33`, and `crm-journey.atomic-write.test.ts:172,187`. Those are
reusable scaffolding for a future fixture, but they are test-authored shapes, not evidence of what
production enforces — which is exactly why they cannot close Slice 0.

## What unblocks Slice 1

Either of the two paths the spec already names — nothing else:

1. A human/ops operator with prod (or verified schema-clone, per the `hub-local-qa-stack-recipe`
   operator memory) read access runs the four queries in spec §3 Slice 0 and pastes the results
   into the PR:
   - `pg_policies` rows (name, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check) for both CRM tables,
   - `pg_class.relrowsecurity` / `relforcerowsecurity` for both,
   - `information_schema.role_table_grants` for grantee `app_ledger`,
   - the `organizations.id` column definition.
2. A scoped, read-only credential provisioned for that recon step only (never committed,
   never logged) — a decision for whoever runs the dev stage, not for this spec.

With those in hand, Slice 1's fixture DDL and its exact catalog assertions must be written to
match them literally (policy name/count, `permissive`, exact role set, `cmd`, `qual`,
`with_check`), rejecting any missing or extra policy.

## Open end (ledger)

The `TODO(handoff):` marker at
`src/server/services/crm-funnel.concurrent.integration.test.ts:21` is intentionally left in
place: its open end — the concurrency proof executes on no automated gate — is still open, and
removing the marker while it is open is precisely what Slice 2 forbids until the gate is green.

## Reconfirmation — run `12bb3918`, 2026-08-20 (same day, spec reopened)

The spec was reopened (`approved_reason`: the prior zero-diff "done" flip was wrong — Slices 1-2
genuinely remain) and sent back through dev. This run re-ran the same recon independently, with
no assumptions carried over from the report above, and found **zero drift**:

- `git diff --name-only 5e77bbe7a origin/master -- src/server/services/crm-funnel.concurrent.integration.test.ts .github/workflows/ci.yml src/server/db/pg-crm-schema.ts`
  is still empty; `origin/master` is at `4a7f219` (this run's merge-base), which already contains
  the report above from PR #150 — no new commits touched any of the three files since.
- `gh secret list` / `gh variable list` on `NikolasP98/minion_hub`: still only
  `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and `FACTORY_HOOK_SECRET`; no Supabase credential, still empty.
- `SUPABASE_DB_URL` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` / `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: unset in this
  sandbox's process env, same as before.
- **New finding, not previously recorded:** `docker`, `psql`, and `pg_dump` are **not installed**
  in this dev sandbox. This means even if the authoritative RLS text were supplied today, this
  sandbox could not itself run Slice 1's own machine-checkable DoD (`docker run ... postgres:15`
  + `psql -f supabase/ci-fixtures/crm-funnel-concurrent.sql`) to prove the fixture applies
  cleanly before committing it — that verification step needs an environment with Docker, not
  just the credential. Worth flagging to whoever unblocks A1, since it changes what "provide the
  RLS text" alone would unblock here.

Conclusion unchanged: Slice 0 remains blocked on the same two paths already named above (human
recon paste, or a scoped read-only credential). No fixture is added in this run. Slices 1 and 2
remain not implemented, deliberately, for the same reason as PR #150.
